# Blackhole-LLM: An Innovative Architecture for Next-Generation LLMs

Blackhole-LLM is my experimental Python project focused on **developing and refining an advanced architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Leveraging `PyTorch`, my work aims to revolutionize how both **textual and numerical data** are processed, with a strong emphasis on mathematical reasoning, structured input handling, and the overall modularity of the entire system.

### Key Architectural Features

My Blackhole-LLM architecture stands out with the following innovations:

  * **Innovative Tokenizer**: A custom extension of `GPT2TokenizerFast`, designed for efficient handling of numerical data, mathematical symbols, and structured input. It focuses on reducing vocabulary size while preserving semantic precision.
  * **Dual Embedding Architecture**: A unique approach to data embedding that combines traditional textual embeddings with advanced numerical embeddings. This allows the model to gain a deeper understanding of both linguistic and quantitative contexts.
  * **Modular Design**: The project is designed as a collection of independent yet closely integrated modules (`tokenizer`, `embedding`, `nova`), facilitating development, testing, and future expansion.
  * **Focus on Numerical Data and Mathematics**: The architecture is optimized from the ground up for processing numerical data, making it ideal for applications requiring precise mathematical reasoning.
  * **Internal Benchmarks and Unit Tests**: Integration of comprehensive tests and benchmarks for individual architectural components (e.g., tokenizer, embeddings) ensures their high quality and comparability.

### Core Components

My Blackhole-LLM project consists of several key packages and scripts that collectively build its architecture:

  * **`blackhole/tokenizer/`**: This directory contains my innovative tokenizer, responsible for text processing, recognition, and special handling of numerical data, symbols, and formatting.
      * For detailed information on its operation, benefits, limitations, and the results of my **internal benchmarks**, please refer to: **[Tokenizer Details and Benchmarks](https://www.google.com/search?q=Benchmark_Tokenizer.md)**
  * **`blackhole/embedding/`**: These modules are responsible for creating embeddings, including my advanced system for numerical data that transforms numbers into vectors understandable by the model.
      * Learn more about my numerical embeddings architecture, its benefits, challenges, and future plans here: **[Numerical Embeddings Details and Benchmarks](https://www.google.com/search?q=Benchmark_Embedding.md)**
  * **`blackhole/nova/`**: This is the designated location for the core language model architecture (e.g., a Transformer class) that will integrate tokens and numerical embeddings.
  * **`scripts/`**: This directory contains various scripts for project management, including:
      * Unit tests (`scripts/tests/`).
      * Benchmark scripts (`scripts/benchmarks/`).
      * Model training and evaluation scripts (under development).

### Future Development Plans

My long-term goal is to build a full, effective LLM that fully leverages the capabilities of my innovative tokenizer and embedding architecture. Subsequent development stages include:

  * Further development and optimization of the main model architecture (`NovaModel`).
  * Implementation and refinement of the complete LLM training process, utilizing dual embeddings.
  * Adding advanced evaluation and prediction functionalities for the entire model.
  * Integration with larger datasets and real-world NLP tasks.
